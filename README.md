Title : Handwriting Recognition
This application is intended to provide web based GUI, using which one can convert their handwritten notes to electronic files. Filtering techniques are used to pre-process the image before it is fed to the tesseract OCR engine. The tesseract engine converts the image to electronic text file.
Final application lets user to download the file as text or pdf, also letting the user to upload the text file directly to their Google drive.

#Tesseract OCR Engine Tool

* Tesseract is an open source text recognizer (OCR) Engine, available under the Apache 2.0 license.

* Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows. In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.

* The existing model  has been trained on about 400000 textlines spanning about 4500 fonts.

* Tesseract uses LSTM Neural Network.
